How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
  To ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure, I recommend using an environment with security measures that reinforce a protected environment. I would also use a programming language and structure based on the project's needs. Regarding functionality, I need to understand the pros and cons of the language and any possible challenges that may arise during development. Lastly, I ensure that any problems or flaws are fixed, as it will allow security to be adaptable during the development process. 

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
  I will interpret user needs as a requirement to make the product or service more valuable. To incorporate them into a program, the user will be engaging with the program so that the user will understand any of their preferences and goals. An example of this would be functionalities geared towards helping the user accomplish their needs. In addition, features will help provide methods for serving user needs. This indicates the connection between the user and the program as features are not needed but define how functions are implemented.  

How do I approach designing software?
  When designing software, having a structured design provides an understanding of how to solve problems and allows designers to focus on issues more accurately. In addition, a systematic design will also help solve a problem by dividing it into minor issues, which can be solved until the whole situation is fixed. There are numerous ways to design software, but using a more supporting approach is essential based on the software being developed.
